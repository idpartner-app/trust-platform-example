# Running the Bank Services
Follow these steps to get the Bank Services (and Trust Platform) operational:

1. Set up the Bank Services by executing the setup script: `./scripts/setup_local.sh`.
2. Launch the Bank Services using Docker Compose: `docker-compose up`.

Ensure that both steps complete successfully without any errors.

## Next steps
Congratulations on configuring the Trust Platform! The next step is to [register a Relying Party](https://docs.idpartner.com/documentation/relying-party-user-guide) and start testing the integration.
