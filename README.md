# Trust Platform Example
This project provides instructions on how to configure the IDPartner Trust Platform and integrate it with the Bank Services.

Currently, there are two methods to deploy the IDPartner Trust Platform:
- **[Self-hosted Trust Platform](./self-hosted/)**. You host both the Trust Platform Services and Bank Services.
- **[IDParnter-hosted Trust Platform](./idpartner-hosted/)**. IDPartner hosts the Trust Platform Services, and you host the Bank Services.

The simplest way to deploy the IDPartner Trust Platform, regardless of the chosen hosting option, is to download it from [IDPartner's Console](https://console.idpartner.com). However, if you prefer to configure it manually, please select a hosting option from the ones listed above and follow the corresponding instructions.
